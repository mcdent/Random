I found what is probably one of my earliest posts to the internet. It dates to 1991 just before I discovered Linux, I was playing with SCO Xenix on a 286 class PC, here is the post:-


Nos/Net for SysV Xenix???

Does anyone know where I can obtain the neccessary files for running Net or
preferably Nos, on my SCO Xenix, System V setup?? I have recently installed Xenix on my home system, and would like to get 'on
the air' with Tcp/Ip. I currently run Nos under MsDos, but am keen to operate it
with Xenix.
The version of Xenix is 2.3.2. I do not have direct access to the Internet but can collect files and mail from kelvin.uk22.bull.com. (128.35.110.6).
Please address mail to g6phf@kelvin.uk22.bull.com, or via the digest.
Thanks in advance.
Mike, G6PHF.

In case you are wondering g6phf is my ham radio callsign, I had no direct access to the early Internet in those days, instead I used to dial in to a system
ran by Kelvin Hill (thanks Kelvin!) and collect and send email from there. I think we were just about up to 2400bps modems in those days!
